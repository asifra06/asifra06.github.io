## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* **Lab 4, Part 2**

   A lab that I really enjoyed was Lab 4, Part 2 because it felt like making a real mini-game where the program responds to what the player types. As someone who is completely new to coding, having the ability to interact with users by giving hints like “Too high” or “Too low” and then letting the player try one more time was something I found fulfilling. I learned how to plan the program flow using if / else if conditions and how important it is to print the exact expected messages so the tests and output match correctly.

* **Lab 7, Part 1**

   Lab 7, Part 1 stood out to me when deciding which ones were my favorite because it was structured as a real-life problem with restrictions that we needed to keep in mind. It gave me a sense of motivation because it shows the work I put into learning that has allowed me to solve real-world problems. I learned how to break a big problem into smaller helper functions and how important input validation is because the program needs to catch bad arguments and print the correct error message instead of crashing.

* **Lab 8, Part 2**

   Lab 8, Part 2 is a favorite of mine because of its uniqueness. I thought it was so interesting how my code can turn into a neatly formatted pattern. I liked seeing how a small change to the loop counters changed the whole output, especially how the dashes increased while the bars decreased on each line. I learned how to use nested loops to control repeated output, and I also learned to pay close attention to boundaries (like stopping at exactly 22 lines) so the program matches the expected output perfectly.
